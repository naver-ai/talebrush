50Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .	0
0Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .	0

100Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .	0

0Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	1
100This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .	0

50Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , The Full Monty , with something different .	1
50An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .	1
100The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .	1
50A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .	0
50But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .	0
100This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .	0

0Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .	1
0A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder .	0

50Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .	1
0Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .	0
50Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary .	0
0One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .	0
0It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	1
100Exceptionally well acted by Diane Lane and Richard Gere .	1
0Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .	0
50... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance	1

0As happily glib and vicious as its characters .	0
50A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .	1
100Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .	0

0There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .	0
0Not since Ghostbusters has a film used Manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .	0
100However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .	0

100One of recent memory 's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .	1
50Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .	1

50As the movie traces Mr. Brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .	0
0If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .	0
100It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .	0
0Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .	1
100There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .	1

50The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .	1
50With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .	1
50The film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of Abagnale 's antics .	1
50The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !	1
0Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .	1
